# Upgrading

## From 1.x to 2.x

- Run the following command to fetch the latets version of the package: `composer require f9webltd/laravel-api-response-helpers:^2.0`
- The package now requires PHP `^8.0` and Laravel `^8.12` / `^9.0` or `^10.0`
- No further changes are required, the API remains the same
